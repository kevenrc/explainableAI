# Explainable FICO
An explainable machine learning dashboard for FICO lending decisions.

## Motivation for this project:
90% of loan decisions in the United States use the FICO credit score resulting in billions of dollars relying on the FICO credit score. Consumers are often not made aware how their specific spending habits may affect their application for a loan.

The explainable AI dashboard I have developed allows users to see what particualr habits are affecting them. It also allows them to try "What if" predicitons on the model.
